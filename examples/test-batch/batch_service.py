    Consumes a significant amount of CPU for a specified duration, useful for testing.

    This function attempts to consume a target percentage of CPU by performing
    mathematical operations in a loop.  It's single-threaded, so its
    effectiveness in consuming a specific percentage of *total* CPU will
    depend on the number of CPU cores available.  For example, on a
    quad-core machine, this function targeting 80% will consume roughly
    80% of one core's capacity, or 20% of the total CPU.

    Args:
        duration_seconds: The number of seconds to consume CPU.
        target_cpu_percent: The target CPU utilization as a percentage (0-100).
            Note that achieving a precise percentage is difficult due to
            Python's overhead and the nature of CPU scheduling.
